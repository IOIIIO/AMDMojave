# Downloading the recovery image

Now that you have downloaded gibmacOS, you need to go to the folder where you downloaded it. Either:

* `cd` there with command prompt or PowerShell
* Open the folder where it is, hold shift and right click and select `Open PowerShell Window here`

Now that we are in the same place as our script, we can use it to download the recovery image, and then later also restore it to our USB drive.

1. run `python gibMacOS.command -r -v 10.14.1`
2. While the software downloads the image: 
   1. Grab your USB drive
   2. _**BACKUP EVERYTHING ON IT**_
   3. Format it to fat32

When it's done downloading, let's proceed to the next part.
