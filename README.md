# In the beginning there was nothing.

So you have decided to make a vanilla Mojave installer for your AMD system, but for some reason don't have access to a VM or a Mac to make one properly. Maybe you don't have enough RAM for your VM, or maybe you just don't have a big enough USB drive. \(seriously? No 8GB drive in 2019?\)  
  
Some smart minds realised that since real Mac's can install a new OS directly from the web, there must be a way for us to do so too. Well, we eventually did figure it out. First an Intel version was created, and now the AMD version has been born.

#### Heavily inspired by the [guide of Midi for Intel.](https://internet-install.gitbook.io/macos-internet-install/)

## So what are we doing?

Let's extremely oversimplify what we will be doing in this guide.

1. Download the macOS recovery
2. Flash it to a USB drive
3. Add a prelinked kernel
4. Install Clover
5. Configure Clover
6. Install macOS \(hopefully\)
7. ???
8. Profit

* Many other folks who made this happen.
