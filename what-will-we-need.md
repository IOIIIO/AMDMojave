# What will we need?

## Hardware wise

* Knowledge on how to use a terminal. If you mistype something and your PC sets on fire, don't blame me or anyone else from the credits list. \(Why is this in hardware? idk. Let's call the brain hardware.\)
* **Knowing what NIC you have is essential.**
* A **Ryzen** based system. \(I don't have an FX to test on, so this guide may or may not work there.\)
* **A LAN connection. Wifi, BT w/e won't work.** _**\[CRITICAL\]**_
* **A fast internet connection.**
  * You don't need datacentre level speeds, but something over 20mbit/s would be preferable. A download at this speed takes about an hour.
* Google. Please learn to google properly.
* _**YOUR BRAIN.**_

## Software side

* **Python 2.7** or later
  * [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/â€‹)
  * Make sure you enable "add to PATH" in the install
* **A good text editor.** I personally recommend Visual Studio:Code
  * [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads)
* **gibMacOs.** A great set of tools made by CorpNewt that we will be using through this entire guide.
* [Download](https://github.com/CorpNewt/gibMacOS)
* ~~The link above is my fork of the tool with added AMD functionality to make your life easier.~~ 
  * This is broken, use the normal one.
* **Install files**
  * 10.14.1:
    * [Download](https://github.com/IOIIIO/AMDMojave/tree/master/files) \(Credits to Shaneee\)
  * Other versions coming soon.
