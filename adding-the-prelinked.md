# Adding the prelinked

Well congrats. You have created an installer that will probably work on an Intel machine, but you are on AMD \(why else are you reading this guide. Go to midi to get your Intel fix\).

Now we need to make it bootable on AMD. For this we will need a few files, which you downloaded earlier on in the guide.

1. Open TransMac
2. Go to `Tools > Settings > Disk Drives/Images` and enable read/write access.

1. Browse to OS X Base System
2. `System > Library`
3. Create a folder called Kernels, by right clicking
4. Copy the kernel to Kernels
5. Unzip the prelinkedkernel.amd and copy it to PrelinkedKernels
